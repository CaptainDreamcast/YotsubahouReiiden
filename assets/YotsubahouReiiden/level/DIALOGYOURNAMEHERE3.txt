Shii[normal]: OwO what's this?
yournamehere: I was okay with the crazy guy, the narcissist and the hacker, but I'm not sure I can take a weeb on top of that.
Shii: *teleports behind you* nothin personnel.
fission: This is Shii aka menchii. He is most notable for getting the site deleted back in the day. 
yournamehere: Oh I remember him, he used to be a moderator with us until a few years ago.
Shii: Hey! You still owe me money, yournamehere!
fission: Yes, after that, he was a mod for a while.
Shii: Why aren't you paying any attention to me, I brought my super cool Samurai Maid X cosplay and all you guys do is talk to each other.
yournamehere: I think the level boss entry means he's a bad guy right now.
Shii: I'm going to take off my limiter and this site will be finished in five minutes after I use 'that'!
yournamehere: Total bad guy.
fission: Yup.
